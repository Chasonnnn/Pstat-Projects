Special Codes:
NA: Missing or unavailable information

Data Transformations:
Handling of Missing Values: Rows with missing 'zipcode' values were removed. 
Observations with 'livingArea' or 'price' as 0 were also removed.
Observations with both ‘Bedrooms’ and ‘Bathrooms’ as 0 were removed.
Feature Engineering: 'bedrooms' and 'bathrooms' were combined into ‘bed_bath_ratio' as a new feature for analysis.
'Area' and 'Price' were combined into ‘price_per_area’ as a new feature for analysis.
